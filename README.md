```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle

```

Or install it yourself as:

```

---

## Configuration

Before using the pdflayer API client you have to setup your account and obtain your API Access Key.  
You can get it by signing up at [https://pdflayer.com/product](https://pdflayer.com/product).

---

## API Overview
All endpoints in the public API is available through this library.

- convert

---

## Usage

The general API is documented here: [https://pdflayer.com/documentation](https://pdflayer.com/documentation).  
You can find parameters, result set definitions and status codes documented here as well.

In the examples directory you can find demos and samples of general usage of all the API functions.

### Setup

```
@client = PDFlayer::Client.new( [access_key], [secret_key] )

```

#### Required Parameters

###### access_key
Your unique key that you can find on the dashboard of your account under the pdflayer account.

###### secret_key
A userdefined private key that you can find on the dashboard of your account under the pdflayer account, it's used to encrypt parameters to prevent unauthorised usage of your account.

#### Optional Parameters

###### Secure (only available for Basic, Pro and Enterprise accounts)
Boolean value to indicate if the calls to the API should use a secure protocol or insecure (HTTP/HTTPS). Defaults to false (HTTP, insecure).

---

## Convert (simple case)
Takes a URL and returns the captured image.

###### Define Query
Second we define an options object.
All the options are documented here: [https://pdflayer.com/documentation](https://pdflayer.com/documentation)

```
options = PDFlayer::ConvertOptions.new()

```

###### Call Client
We then place the actual call to the API, passing in the URL we wish to capture as PDF and the options we defined above.

```
response = @client.convert(document_url, options)

``` 

###### Response

```
[The binary content of the PDF file]

```

---

## Convert (w. export)
Takes a URL, saves the PDF to a local file defined by the export argument and returns a response object.

###### Define Query

We define an options object, and sets the ```export``` option.
This option is specific to the RubyGem and not documented in the API found on pdflayer.

```
options = PDFlayer::ConvertOptions.new()
options.export = '[local_file_system]/some_directory]/my_file.pdf'

```

###### Simple Request (using Callback)

```
response = @client.convert(document_url, options)

```

###### Response
```
{
	"success": true,
    "info": "The PDF file has been saved to your local file system",
    "file_name": "path_to_local_file.pdf"
}
```

---

## Example Application

In the [rootdir]/example directory there is a fully functional application which runs all requests against all the endpoints in the API, the examples above can be seen there as source code.

The example application uses a process.env variable to hold the access key.

---

## Tests

The tests are written for any NodeJS testing library, but has been run and targeted at the [https://mochajs.org/](https://mochajs.org/) testing library.

In order to run the tests, the following environment variables needs to be set:

```
ACCESS_KEY = [access_key]
SECRET_KEY = [secret_key]
```
